# core :: public

This is the public directory - or in lamens terms where the magic happens.

**If** you read the Apache Configuration file you would notice that this directory is the *web root*. 

This is where I keep the index.php file to start the application, but also all styles/scripts and images.

The reason I have both ***css*** and ***scss*** directories is because during development I like to build in SASS and compile at runtime
