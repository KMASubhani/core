This is my starter PHP Application, which will server as a Boilerplate for quick starting builds using my common methods and build techniques.

* Apache Configuration is included. However I will be working on a **Vagrant** Install script and more than likely porting over to *Nginx* soon.


If you use something like **composer** then you will only require the *src* directory and then *composer.json* file.
